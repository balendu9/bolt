after creating a project in convex website, in the terminal:

1) run: npm install convex
2) npx convex dev
3) will ask to create or use existing project.
4) if already created just select that.
5) then there will be this folder created, and will have some generated code, stored in _generated folder.

Inside the convex folder(outside the _generated folder), the files i created are these:

1) schema.js

2) ConvexClientProvider.jsx: inside the main app folder, outside the convex folder

3) users.js (inside this folder)
